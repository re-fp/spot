# Goals/Outcomes ‚ú®

- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently
- Feel free to modify the base source code and styles as you like.
- Feel free to add packages (i.e. Redux, Recoil, React Query, etc.)

&nbsp;

# Pre-requisites ‚úÖ

- Node 16
- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to a `.env` file in root using the environment variables
- https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/

`REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

- Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

# Think about üí°

- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

&nbsp;

# What's Already Been Done üèÅ

- UI/UX for all elements, including previews (mobile responsive)

&nbsp;
